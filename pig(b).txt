Top 3 employees (employee id and employee name) with highest salary, whose employee id
is an odd number. (In case two employees have same salary, employee with name coming first
in dictionary should get preference) 

emp_fil = filter emp_det by (id % 2) != 0;
emp1_order = order emp_fil by salary desc;
lim1 = limit emp1_order 3;
emp1 = foreach lim1 generate id, name;
dump emp1;
